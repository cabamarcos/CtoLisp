# CtoLisp

To use this code I suggest you to use a linux environment.

To clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cabamarcos/CtoLisp.git
```

Install clisp:

```bash
sudo apt-get install clisp
```

To try the translator you can use this command:

```bash
./trad <prueba.c >prueba.l
clisp prueba.l
```

The last version of the trsanslator is located in this [file](./trad5.y)
